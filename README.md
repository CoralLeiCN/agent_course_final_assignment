# step by step
1. Develop the app locally by clone the repo, for example:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/CoralLeiCN/agent_course_final_assignment
cd agent_course_final_assignment
```
NOTE: if the space is private, you need to use `git clone https://{username}:{token}@huggingface.co ....` instead

2. sync the repo to github (optional)
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/CoralLeiCN/agent_course_final_assignment.git
```
Github guide on [Adding a local repository to GitHub using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git)

3. Create and activate Python environment by uv
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. (optional) As we are running the app outside of a Space environment, we need to logged in to Huggingface
```bash
huggingface-cli login

5. run the app locally
```bash
uv run app.py
# Or Automatically reloads the Gradio app
uv run gradio app.py
```

# experiments
The score is max score after a few runs
| Features | Model | Score (out of 20) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prompted LLM | gemini-flash 2.0 | 1 | Format could be wrong |
| + Structured Output | gemini-flash 2.0 | 3 |  |
| + System prompt from GAIA, slightly modified | gemini-flash 2.0 | 3 |  |
| + Agentic LLM with Smolagent & Add ‚ÄúUnderstand video‚Äù tool using gemini-flash. | gemini-flash 2.0 | 4 | Results varied due to `Codeagent` output formatting issues. |
| + WebSearchTool | gemini-flash 2.0 | 7 | Greatly improved, still has formatting issues |
| + Change from flash 2.0 to flash 2.5 | gemini-flash 2.5 | 7 |  |
| + VisitWebpageTool | gemini-flash 2.5 | 10-12 | Cannot see image, mp3, excel file. |
| + DownloadFile & ReadExcelFileBytes | gemini-flash 2.5 | 13 |  |
| + TranscribeAudioBytes | gemini-flash 2.5 | 14 |  |
| + CodeExecutionTool | gemini-flash 2.5 | 14 |  |
| + WikipediaSearchTool (customised using wikipedia + markdownify) | gemini-flash 2.5 | 15 | Tested both WikipediaRetriever and WikipediaLoader from LangChain, but their performance was limited ‚Äî those omit table data, which can include key information. |
| + Increase thinking budget on flash2.5 for performance & Edited system prompt | gemini-flash 2.5, temperature = 0 for consistency. | 15-17 | Stability is the key challenge. Can achieve 17 with GAIA score function, but this assignment is using exact match, so formatter needs improvement. |
| + chess best move tool & Change Image understanding model to gemini-pro 2.5 | gemini-flash 2.5 & gemini-pro 2.5 | 18 | conversion of digital chessboard images to FEN strings is unstable. |
